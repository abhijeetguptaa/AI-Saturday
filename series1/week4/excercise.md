Refer to https://github.com/keplerlab/AI-Saturday/blob/master/week4/BiasVariance.pptx to understand the best practices
on bias and variance

## How learning rate impacts the Bias and variance on plant seedlings and invasive species monitoring
1. Try with different learning rates to see the impact and share the results on slack. 

## How differential learning rate impacts the Bias and variance on plant seedlings and invasive species monitoring.
1.  Try with different splits of learning rates to see the impact and share the results on slack

## How number of cycle multiplier impacts the Bias and variance on plant seedlings and invasive species monitoring.
1.  Try with different cycle multipliers to see the impact and share the results on slack.
